        <h2>About No Comply Games</h2>
        <p>
          No Comply is a small indie game studio based in Ohio, creating experimental games 
          that blend tactical mechanics, procedural chaos, and a love for tightly tuned systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to make games that surprise you with every run, reward creative thinking, 
          and deliver memorable moments through emergent play.
        </p>
        <h3>What’s with the name?</h3>
        <p>
          A “no comply” is a classic street skateboarding trick. We loved the name because it 
          speaks to the spirit of doing things differently — just like our games.
